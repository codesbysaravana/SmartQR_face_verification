🚀 30 Days of Cloud x AI Projects – Day 7: Smart QR + Face Verification System!

Today, I built a complete identity verification system that's not just smart, but also designed for free-tier / no-cost setup! This project tackles real-world security and efficiency challenges using readily available tech.

🎯 What it does:

✅ Uploads and decodes QR Code images (extracts IDs, hashes, etc.)

✅ Uploads face images for comparison

🧠 Validates identity by matching QR content with AI-powered face recognition

🚀 Provides instant verification results (match/no match)

🛠️ Tech Stack & How I Kept it Cost-Free:

QR Code Detection: pyzbar (open-source)

Face Comparison: OpenCV + FaceNet (via face_recognition library) – no AWS Rekognition needed for free tier!

Image Upload & UI: Streamlit

Backend Logic: Python

Hosting: Deployable via Streamlit Cloud (free tier)

This approach highlights how powerful AI solutions can be built and deployed without incurring significant cloud costs, making advanced tech accessible for solo builders and small projects.



🔍 Why it matters & Use Cases:

In a world that demands quick and secure identity checks, this system is a game-changer. Imagine:

🎓 College Events: Scan ID card QR + face match for seamless entry.

🏢 Office Attendance: QR badge scan + facial confirmation for clock-ins.

🛂 Border/KYC: Live face vs. passport photo verification.

📦 Smart Delivery: Match recipient ID & face before handoff.

🔥 Key Takeaway:

You don't always need complex, expensive infrastructure to build powerful AI-driven solutions. Resourcefulness and open-source tools can unlock incredible potential for secure and efficient systems!
